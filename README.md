# TasksMonster
## The rationale behind it
On Aug 2015 ["she codes;"](http://www.she-codes.org/) launched the program "she codes; Academy" - free-of-charge Web and Android study courses for women without any previous programming background. The need for a well-designed software that automatically sends learning tasks and monitors the student’s progress, arose during the very first week of "she codes; academy" launch.

*TasksMonster* is a computer app which sends weekly studying tasks via email in accordance to the student’s personal progress. *TasksMonster* also monitors student’s progress &amp; attendance and more. It was created for "she codes;" WIS branch on Aug 7, 2015 and had been used by both students and managers. *TasksMonster* had been used until the *AttendanceManagerMonster* was released.

*TasksMonster* and *[AttendanceManagerMonster](https://github.com/DarLador/AttendanceManagerMonster)* applications were the source of inspiration for the latter development of [shecodesconnect.com](https://shecodesconnect.com/) - which is an implementation of this platform at national level.

## The application
*TasksMonster* application was built in Anaconda Python 2.7 on windows OS.
