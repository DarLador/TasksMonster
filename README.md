# TasksMonster
## The rationale behind it
On Aug 2015 "she codes;" launched "she codes; Academy" - free-of-charge Web and Android study tracks for women without any previous programming background. The need for well designed software which automatically sends tasks and monitors the students progress arose in the very first day of "she codes; academy".

TasksMonster is a computer app which sends weekly tasks via email in accordance to the personal progress. TasksMonster also monitors student progress &amp; attendance and more. It was created for "she codes;" WIS branch on Aug 7, 2015 and used by both students and managers. TasksMonster was used until the AttendanceManagerMonster was released. 

TasksMonster and AttendanceManagerMonster applications were the source of inspiration for shecodesconnect.com - implementation of this platform at national level.

## The application
TasksMonster application was built in Anaconda Python 2.7 on windows. 
As soon as time permits I will upload a new version with related files so that the software will work on any PC.
